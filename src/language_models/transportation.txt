§ 442.1 General applicability.
(a) As defined more specifically in each subpart, and except for discharges specified in paragraph (b) of this
section, this part applies to discharges resulting from cleaning the interior of tanks used to transport
chemical, petroleum or food grade cargos. This part does not apply to facilities that clean only the
exteriors of transportation equipment. Operations which may be subject to this part typically are reported
under a wide variety of Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Several of the most common SIC
codes include: SIC 7699, SIC 4741, or SIC 4491 (1987 SIC Manual).
(b) This part is not applicable to the following discharges:
(1) Wastewaters associated with tank cleanings operated in conjunction with other industrial,
commercial, or Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) operations, provided that the cleaning is
limited to tanks that previously contained raw materials, by-products, or finished products that are
associated with the facility's on-site processes.
(2) Wastewaters resulting from cleaning the interiors of drums, intermediate bulk containers, or closedtop hoppers.
(3) Wastewater from a facility that discharges less than 100,000 gallons per year of transportation

human consumption, fruit juices, honey, lard, molasses, non-alcoholic beverages, sweeteners, tallow,
vegetable oils, and vinegar.
Heel means any material remaining in a tank following unloading, delivery, or discharge of the transported
cargo. Heels may also be referred to as container residue, residual materials or residuals.
Intermediate bulk container (“IBC” or “Tote”) means a completely enclosed storage vessel used to hold
liquid, solid, or gaseous commodities or cargos which are in direct contact with the container
interior. IBCs may be loaded onto flat beds for either truck or rail transport, or onto ship decks for

gallons) capacity. IBCs are also commonly referred to as totes or tote bins.
Intermodal tank container means a completely enclosed storage vessel used to hold liquid, solid, or
gaseous commodities or cargos which come in direct contact with the tank interior. Intermodal tank
containers may be loaded onto flat beds for either truck or rail transport, or onto ship decks for water
transport. Containers larger than 3000 liters capacity are considered intermodal tank containers.
Containers smaller than 3000 liters capacity are considered IBCs.
Ocean/sea tanker means a self or non-self-propelled vessel constructed or adapted to transport liquid,
solid or gaseous commodities or cargos in bulk in cargo spaces (or tanks) through oceans and seas,
where the commodity or cargo carried comes in direct contact with the tank interior. There are no
maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes.

gases (LPG) including butane and propane; lubrication oils; mineral spirits; naphtha; olefin, paraffin,
and other waxes; tall oil; tar; toluene; xylene; and waste oil.
Pollution Prevention Allowable Discharge for this subpart means the quantity of/concentrations of
pollutants in wastewaters being discharged to publicly owned treatment works after a facility has
demonstrated compliance with the Pollutant Management Plan provisions in § 442.15(b), §
442.16(b), § 442.25(b), or § 442.26(b) of this part.
Prerinse/presteam means a rinse, typically with hot or cold water, performed at the beginning of the
cleaning sequence to remove residual material from the tank interior.
Presolve wash means the use of diesel, kerosene, gasoline, or any other type of fuel or solvent as a tank
interior cleaning solution.
Rail Tank Car means a completely enclosed storage vessel pulled by a locomotive that is used to transport
liquid, solid, or gaseous commodities or cargos over railway access lines. A rail tank car storage
vessel may have one or more storage compartments and the stored commodities or cargos come in
direct contact with the tank interior. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes.
Tank barge means a non-self-propelled vessel constructed or adapted primarily to carry liquid, solid or
gaseous commodities or cargos in bulk in cargo spaces (or tanks) through rivers and inland
waterways, and may occasionally carry commodities or cargos through oceans and seas when in
transit from one inland waterway to another. The commodities or cargos transported are in direct
contact with the tank interior. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes.
Tank truck means a motor-driven vehicle with a completely enclosed storage vessel used to transport
liquid, solid or gaseous materials over roads and highways. The storage vessel or tank may be
detachable, as with tank trailers, or permanently attached. The commodities or cargos transported
come in direct contact with the tank interior. A tank truck may have one or more storage
compartments. There are no maximum or minimum vessel or tank volumes. Tank trucks are also
commonly referred to as cargo tanks or tankers.
Transportation equipment cleaning (TEC) process wastewater means all wastewaters associated with
cleaning the interiors of tanks including: tank trucks; rail tank cars; intermodal tank containers; tank
barges; and ocean/sea tankers used to transport commodities or cargos that come into direct
contact with the interior of the tank or container. At those facilities that clean tank interiors, TEC
process wastewater also includes wastewater generated from washing vehicle exteriors, equipment
and floor washings, TEC-contaminated stormwater, wastewater prerinse cleaning solutions,
chemical cleaning solutions, and final rinse solutions. TEC process wastewater is defined to include
only wastewater generated from a regulated TEC subcategory. Therefore, TEC process wastewater
does not include wastewater generated from cleaning hopper cars, or from food grade facilities
discharging to a POTW. Wastewater generated from cleaning tank interiors for purposes of shipping
products (i.e., cleaned for purposes other than maintenance and repair) is considered TEC process

(1) The discharger shall prepare a Pollutant Management Plan that satisfies the requirements as
specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, and the discharger shall conduct its operations in
accordance with that plan.
(2) The discharger shall notify its local control authority prior to obtaining, renewing, or modifying its
individual control mechanism or pretreatment agreement of its intent to achieve the pollution
prevention allowable discharge pretreatment standard by submitting to the local control authority a
certification statement of its intent to utilize a Pollutant Management Plan as specified in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section. The certification statement must be signed by the responsible corporate officer
as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(l);
(3) The discharger shall submit a copy of its Pollutant Management Plan as described in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section to the appropriate control authority at the time he/she applies to obtain, renew,

Pollutant Management Plan as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(5) The Pollutant Management Plan shall include:
(i)

Procedures for identifying cargos, the cleaning of which is likely to result in discharges of
pollutants that would be incompatible with treatment at the POTW;

(ii) For cargos identified as being incompatible with treatment at the POTW, the Plan shall provide
that heels be fully drained, segregated from other wastewaters, and handled in an appropriate
manner;
(iii) For cargos identified as being incompatible with treatment at the POTW, the Plan shall provide
that the tank be prerinsed or presteamed as appropriate and the wastewater segregated from
wastewaters to be discharged to the POTW and handled in an appropriate manner, where
necessary to ensure that they do not cause or contribute to a discharge that would be
incompatible with treatment at the POTW;
(iv) All spent cleaning solutions, including interior caustic washes, interior presolve washes, interior
detergent washes, interior acid washes, and exterior acid brightener washes shall be
segregated from other wastewaters and handled in an appropriate manner, where necessary to
ensure that they do not cause or contribute to a discharge that would be incompatible with
treatment at the POTW;
(v) Provisions for appropriate recycling or reuse of cleaning agents;
(vi) Provisions for minimizing the use of toxic cleaning agents (solvents, detergents, or other
cleaning or brightening solutions);
(vii) Provisions for appropriate recycling or reuse of segregated wastewaters (including heels and
prerinse/pre-steam wastes);
(viii) Provisions for off-site treatment or disposal, or effective pre-treatment of segregated
wastewaters (including heels, prerinse/pre-steam wastes, spent cleaning solutions);
