# Scrapped project for Microsoft Imagine 2024

This is a scrapped version of a project for Microsoft Imagine Cup 2024. I decided to change project focus midway and restarted in a different repository with a more centralized focus on automating geospatial data visualization. Since I was planning on deleting this repo anyway, I decided to make it public. 

Note: Whoever somehow stumbles upon this repo and actually wants to run the code, you need to have an Open AI key and Azure Maps API key for this to work. Those keys should replace the holder values in the .env file.
